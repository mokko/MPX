What?
-----
MPX stands for MuseumPlusXML, my XML format that represents data from MuseumPlus. Essentially this project is a schema file. The latest version of the xsd is now at "xsd/mpx.xsd".


T3: Tools, Transformations and Tests
------------------------------------
I am currently adding some related tools, transformations and tests (in perl 
and xsl).


Overlap with my other projects
------------------------------
Note: This project updates some stuff from various of my other projects (levelup, SalsaOAI etc.). I don't gurantee that I remove the old versions in those projects so there might be some overlap. Stuff in this project should be most current.

BRANCHES
--------
Development is now in devel. Public facing version should soon appear in Master at github.
